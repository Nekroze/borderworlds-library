Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up the `borderworlds-library` for local
development allowing you to make your own changes and then publicly submit them
for review and, if accepted, implementation.

1. Fork the `borderworlds-library` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.

    ``$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/borderworlds-library.git``
    ``$ cd borderworlds-library/``

4. Create a branch for local development.

    ``$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature``

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass all tests.

    ``$ make test``

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.

    ``$ git add .``
    ``$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."``
    ``$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature``
